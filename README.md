Here is how I built my code:

 - I created an three arrays of quotes, each array contains three sentences.
 - Then I generated the array randomly using the *Math.floor()* and the *Math.random* functions,
 -  After that I tried to access the quotes together in a new variable.
 -  Create a prompt for the users to enter the number of quotation they want
 -  Then check if the prompt gives us something between 1 to 5
 -  We use for loop to last the number of times that the user entered in the prompt
 -  Generate random index numbers
